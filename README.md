# DapNet-HLA: Adaptive dual-attention mechanism network based on deep learning to predict non-classical HLA binding sites.
------
## The data file consists of five datasets, including HLA-G*01:01, HLA-G*01:03, HLA-G*01:04, HLA-E*01:01 and HLA-E*01:03.   
## This method is used to dichotomize protein sequences. If you want to use this method, first preprocess the sequence using process.py, which trains the model.  
Configuration Environment: python=3.9,torch=1.11
